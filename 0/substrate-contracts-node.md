Running a Substrate Smart Contracts Node

you can start a local development chain by running:

```bash
substrate-contracts-node --dev --tmp
```

You should start seeing blocks being produced by your node in your terminal.

You can interact with your node using the hosted version of Canvas UI at:

Now configure the UI to connect to the locally running node:

- Click on the dropdown selector at bottom left corner.
- Choose the Local Node.
