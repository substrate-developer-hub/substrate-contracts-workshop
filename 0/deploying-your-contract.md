Deploying Your Contract
===

Now that we have generated the Wasm binary from our source code and started a Substrate node, we want to deploy this contract onto our Substrate blockchain.

Smart contract deployment on Substrate is a little different than on traditional smart contract blockchains.

Whereas a completely new blob of smart contract source code is deployed each time you push a contract on other platforms, Substrate opts to optimize this behavior. For example, the standard ERC20 token has been deployed to Ethereum thousands of times, sometimes only with changes to the initial configuration (through the Solidity `constructor` function). Each of these instances take up space on the blockchain equivalent to the contract source code size, even though no code was actually changed.

In Substrate, the contract deployment process is split into two halves:

1. Putting your code on the blockchain
2. Creating an instance of your contract

With this pattern, contract code like the ERC20 standard can be put on the blockchain a single time, but instantiated any number of times. No need to continually upload the same source code over and waste space on the blockchain.

## Putting Your Code on the Blockchain

With your Substrate development node running, you can go back to the [Polkadot UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/) where you will be able to interact with your blockchain.

Open the specially designed **Contracts** section of the UI.

In the **Code** section, select a _deployment account_ with some account balance like `Alice`. In _compiled contract WASM_, select the `flipper.wasm` file we generated. For the _contract ABI_, select the JSON file. Finally, set the _maximum gas allowed_ to `500,000` units.

After you press **Upload** and a new block is formed, a system event is emitted with `contracts.PutCode queued`. This means that the UI is waiting for you to `Sign and Submit` the extrinsic. If the transaction succeeds you will get an `system.ExtrinsicSuccess` event and your WASM contract will be stored on your Substrate blockchain!

> **Note**: If you get a `system.ExtrinsicFailed` error message, you may not have allowed enough gas to execute the call.  You can verify that this is the cause by looking at the logs in the terminal. This may occur on this or any subsequent contract instantiations or calls.  If this occurs, increase the _maximum gas allowed_ argument and try again.

## Creating an Instance of Your Contract

Smart contracts exist as an extension of the account system on the blockchain. Thus creating an instance of this contract will create a new `AccountId` which will store any balance managed by the smart contract and allow us to interact with the contract.

You will notice on the **Code** tab there is a new object that represents our smart contract. We now need to deploy our smart contract to create an **instance**.

The _code for this contract_ is automatically set to the last contract you published. You would be able to choose from a drop down of previous contracts if you created others in the past.

To instantiate our contract we just need to give this contract account an _endowment_ of `10,000,000` and again set the _maximum gas allowed_ to `500,000` units. 

> **Note:** As mentioned earlier, contract creation involves creation of a new Account. As such, you must be sure to give the contract account at least the existential deposit defined by your blockchain. We also need to be able to pay the contract's rent (_`endowment`_). If we consume all of this deposit, the contract will become invalid. We can always refill the contract's balance and keep it on chain.

When you press **Deploy**, you should see a flurry of events appear including the creation of a new account (`balances.NewAccount`) and the instantiation of the contract (`contracts.instantiate`):
